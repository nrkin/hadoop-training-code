Q: For a active community site, we have to consider which factors are required to decide if we need to use Hadoop/MapReduce.

A: The 3 V's of the data should eb found out. We must know
    1. Volume : What is the volume of the data that is generated
    2. Velocity: The speed at which the data is generated
    3. Variety: The different kind of data and the fields in the data.

If these three parameters are high enough such that the data can cannot be efficiently processed by simple processing systems, we can consider Hadoop/MapReduce.
